## Task 1: Implementing Caesar Cipher
**Description:**  
A Python program that implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm for encrypting and decrypting text. Users can input a message and a shift value to encode or decode their messages.  

**Features:**  
- Encryption and decryption functionality.  
- User-friendly input for message and shift value.  
- Output of the transformed text.  

**Technologies Used:** Python.

## Task 2: Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption
**Description:**  
A tool for basic image encryption by manipulating pixel values. Operations such as pixel swapping or applying mathematical transformations are used to secure image data.  

**Features:**  
- Encrypts and decrypts image files.  
- User input to choose the type of manipulation.  
- Simple and effective pixel-based encryption.  

**Technologies Used:** Python, Pillow Library.

## Task 3: Password Complexity Checker
**Description:**  
A program to evaluate the strength of a password based on key criteria. Users receive feedback on the strength of their password and suggestions for improvement.  

**Features:**  
- Checks password length.  
- Evaluates the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.  
- Provides real-time feedback on password strength.  

**Technologies Used:** Python.

## Task 4: Simple Keylogger
**Description:**  
A basic keylogger that logs and saves keystrokes to a file. Designed for educational purposes to understand keylogging techniques and their ethical implications.  

**Features:**  
- Records keystrokes.  
- Saves keystrokes to a log file.  
- Highlights the importance of ethical use.  

**Technologies Used:** Python, Pynput Library.

## Task 5: Network Packet Analyzer
**Description:**  
A network packet sniffer tool that captures and analyzes network traffic. Provides insights into packet details such as source/destination IPs, protocols, and payload data.  

**Features:**  
- Captures live network packets.  
- Analyzes packet headers and payloads.  
- Displays relevant packet information.  

**Technologies Used:** Python, Scapy Library.
